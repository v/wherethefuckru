WherethefuckRU
--------------

This was some of the very first Javascript code I wrote in 2011.

WherethefuckRU is a web application that helps you figure out where a certain address is relative to predefined landmarks. The application as it's written works with addresses around Rutgers University, and tells you how close an address is to bus stops.

I built it because I was looking for offcampus housing and I wanted to search an address, and quickly understand its location.

The live version is available at [http://wherethefuckru.vverma.net/](http://wherethefuckru.vverma.net/).
